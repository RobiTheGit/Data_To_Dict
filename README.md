# Data_To_Dict

This will convert the contents of a file into a dictionary with lists in it.

At the moment, it uses the separator "|" to split between infromation for a person, and newlines to seperate each person, however, these can be changed, and this code can be reworked into whatever your usage calls for

Each line is commented into mostly-plain english

Duplicates get removed from the data dictionary before it is even made

Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/RobiTheGit/Data_To_Dict/wiki) if you want to use this.
